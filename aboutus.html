            <p>We are a not for profit organization. Our goal is simple: to bring members of the community together for a night of food, fun, and laughter! We hold one weekend event every year with two showings of our production.</p>  
            <p>We are the premiere theatre performance organization in North East Florida. Established in 2013, we've drawn hundreds of spectators to our annual weekend events. With showings on Friday night and Saturday afternoon, our previous performances include: Case of the Malted Falcon, Dealt a Deadly Hand, Murder at the Tonylou Awards, Eat Drink and Be Murdered, and Trouble at the Tropicabana.</p>
            <p>In the words of Director Arthur Dolder "The truth is that this is more than just a play. This is a community event. We love our neighbors, we love our community, and we bring people together for dinner, laughter and fun - and that is the measure of our success."</p>
            <p>We look forward to seeing you at one of this year's performances!</p>
